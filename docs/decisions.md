# Decisions

Choices that shaped MyHouse, and why. Add one whenever a choice has a "why" worth
remembering — including those made in an approved Claude plan (plans are kept outside the
repo). Newest at the bottom. Money rules themselves live in [settlement-rules.md](settlement-rules.md).

Format: `## YYYY-MM-DD — Title`, then **Decision** and **Why** (and **Instead of** only when
there was a real alternative).

## 2026-09-27 — Money in integer centavos
**Decision:** all money math is done in whole centavos (`lib/money.ts`); the database stores
`numeric(12,2)`, which Drizzle returns as strings.
**Why:** floats can't represent ₱0.01 exactly, and splits must always add up to the total.

## 2026-09-27 — The full ledger
**Decision:** everyone's Month Final is their share of everything minus what they paid, bills
paid included, the collector like everyone else; the Finals sum to ₱0.00.
**Why:** it's how the household sheet works, and a sum of ₱0.00 is a built-in check.

## 2026-09-27 — The collector absorbs leftover centavos
**Decision:** equal splits hand leftover centavos out collector-first (`splitOrder`).
**Why:** leftovers never land on someone who didn't choose to collect.

## 2026-09-27 — No public deploy until login
**Decision:** the app runs locally only until login exists.
**Why:** anyone with the URL would see the household's finances.

## 2026-09-27 — Schema changes: generate + migrate, never push
**Decision:** `db:generate` writes versioned SQL, which is read before `db:migrate` applies it.
**Instead of:** `drizzle-kit push`, which changes the database directly with no record or review.
**Why:** every change is reviewable and repeatable, and destructive SQL gets caught.

## 2026-09-27 — RLS on every table, no policies
**Decision:** every table has row-level security enabled with no policies.
**Why:** it blocks Supabase's public Data API; the app connects to Postgres directly and isn't affected.

## 2026-09-28 — Forms submit with `onSubmit` + `startTransition`
**Decision:** inline inputs and dialogs submit through `onSubmit` + `startTransition`.
**Instead of:** `<form action={…}>`.
**Why:** React resets a form after every action, even a failed one, which wiped what was typed.

## 2026-09-28 — Keep-alive via GitHub Actions
**Decision:** a scheduled workflow reads one table twice a week.
**Why:** free Supabase projects pause after 7 idle days, and the app is mostly used around month-end.

## 2026-09-28 — Repo and folder renamed to `home-finance-tracker`
**Decision:** GitHub repo `paulfuentesss/home-finance-tracker` (the old `MyHouse` URL still
redirects), local folder `~/Documents/GitHub/home-finance-tracker`. The app is still called
"MyHouse"; renaming the app is undecided ([TODO.md](TODO.md)).

## 2026-09-28 — Bills go in the month the provider names
**Decision:** an emailed bill goes into the month named in the email ("Meralco bill for August
2026"); if none is named, the month holding the middle of the billing period.
**Instead of:** the month it arrives, or the billing period's midpoint alone (PLDT has no period).
**Why:** it matches how the household sheet already assigns bills, so switching to email import
double-counts nothing.

## 2026-09-28 — Emailed bills are pending until confirmed, and never overwrite
**Decision:** an emailed bill fills the month's existing ₱0 column as pending; anything that
doesn't fit goes to the Bill Inbox; a pending bill blocks closing its month.
**Why:** parsing can be wrong and amounts can differ from what was paid, so a person checks
each one; a pending bill left in a closed month could never be confirmed.

## 2026-09-28 — Payment fees are added, shared, and kept as a setting
**Decision:** the fixed fee of the usual way of paying each bill is added on import
(`BILL_PAYMENT_FEES`), shared by everyone, noted on the column, and stored per email.
**Instead of:** editing the amount by hand each month, or reading payment-confirmation emails.
**Why:** the sheet already shares the fees; they only change when the way of paying changes;
storing them per email keeps old months stable.

## 2026-09-28 — The repo stays public; household specifics stay out of it
**Decision:** the repo stays public. Docs are generic; household specifics go in a git-ignored
`.private/NOTES.md`. What's already public (the August fixture) stays as it is.
**Instead of:** making the repo private.

## 2026-09-28 — Docs organized by topic, one home each
**Decision:** README is the short front page, CLAUDE.md is Claude's index, and `docs/` holds
one file per topic: features (the only status list), TODO, decisions, rules, data model,
testing, setup, commands, operations.
**Why:** as the project grows nothing gets forgotten, and nothing is written in two places
that can drift apart.
