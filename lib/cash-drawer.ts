// The admin's cash drawer (docs/features/cash-drawer.md). Pure functions, no DB access, so it's
// easy to test.
//
// - Its lines come from three places: the drawer's own entries (cash in, spent, lent, paid back),
//   and the Helper entries and advances the admin flagged as paid from it.
// - Cash on hand is everything in minus everything out. It may go below ₱0 (a cash in not logged
//   yet); the page points at where.
// - What someone owes the drawer is what they borrowed minus what they paid back, never below ₱0.
// - None of it enters the split: it's the admin's own money.
