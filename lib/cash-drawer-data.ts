// The Cash Drawer's database side (docs/features/cash-drawer.md).
// - getCashDrawer loads the tab: the drawer's own entries plus the Helper entries and advances
//   flagged as paid from it, read live so the drawer always matches them. Admin only — the page
//   redirects anyone else, and this checks again.
// - The writes take the caller's transaction (the Server Actions check who's asking), and each
//   refuses a change that leaves someone having paid back more than they borrowed.
